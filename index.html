          Jewelry in the Americas has an ancient history. Beginning as far back
          as 8800 BCE, Paleo-Indians in the American Southwest drilled and
          shaped multicolored stones and shells into beads and pendants.
          Olivella shell beads, dating from 6000 BCE, were found in Nevada;
          bone, antler, and possibly marine shell beads from 7000 BCE were found
          in Russell Cave in Alabama; copper jewelry was traded from Lake
          Superior beginning in 3000 BCE; and stone beads were carved in Poverty
          Point in Louisiana in 1500 BCE. Learn more.
