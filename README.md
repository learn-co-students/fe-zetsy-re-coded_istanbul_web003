# Zetsy

## Objectives

This lab challenges you to build an Etsy clone, 'Zetsy', by writing
your own HTML & CSS from scratch to match the mockup image:

## What We Want:

</p>

## Instructions

1. Use the text and suggested images listed in `SOURCE.md` to fill in the content for `index.html`
2. Use `css/style.css` to write the CSS code necessary to make your your site page look like the example shown
3. To match the colors, you can eye-drop colors using [Digital Color Meter App](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/apple-in-the-enterprise/discover-the-digitalcolor-meter-tool-on-your-mac/#) if you are using OSX, or a program like [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) for Windows
4. BONUS: Add CSS transitions for the mouse hover events. See: [http://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/](http://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/)

**Note:** If you get stuck, you can use the Developer Tools to inspect the code at the
live site example here: [Zetsy live page
example](http://learn-co-curriculum.github.io/fe-zetsy/). This lab has less
direction than previous labs. As programmers in training, you are expected to
use your Google-Fu to complete the challenge!
